WHY
====

I made this script after seeing a friend picking a ranodm link out of us
bookmarks. It just picks random links out of a text file. They have to be a
newline urls

like this

http://foo.com/
http://barz.org/

Just a weird script


USAGE
=====

-a --add just adds a url to the list
-q --nobroswer just prints out the url instead of opening it in the defualt
broswer

-h --help shows this


Example
========

ranurl -a http://foo_bar.com/ - adds a url
ranurl -q - prints out the random url
ranurl - opens it in a broswer
